# React & Microfrontends

## Agenda: Using ReactJS for Microfrontends with MUI

1. Introduction
   - Overview of using ReactJS to develop microfrontends.
   - Comparison between NPM Module and Microfrontend
   - Brief on Material-UI (MUI) and its role in building encapsulated microfrontends

2. Methodology
   - Explanation of the microfrontend architecture.
   - Setting up a project with ReactJS and Emotion.
   - Techniques for splitting a monolithic frontend into microfrontends.
   - Tools and libraries to facilitate microfrontend development (e.g., Module Federation).

3. Architecture
   - Designing a scalable microfrontend architecture.
   - Communication strategies between microfrontends.
   - Sharing common assets and libraries (e.g., MUI components).
   - Integration with backend services.

4. Common Issues and Pitfalls
   - Handling dependency conflicts.
   - Shadow dom for encapsulation
   - Consistency in design and user experience across microfrontends.
   - Ensuring secure communication and data sharing.

5. Avoiding Common Issues
   - Best practices for dependency management.
   - Strategies for maintaining design consistency (using design systems and shared libraries).
   - Implementing robust security measures.

6. Conclusion and Q&A
   - Recap of the benefits of using ReactJS and MUI for microfrontends.
   - Final thoughts on the future of microfrontend architecture.
   - Encouragement for adopting best practices and continuous learning.
